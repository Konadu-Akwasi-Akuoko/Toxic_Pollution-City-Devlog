# Toxic_Pollution-City-Devlog
In this project I create a pollution ridden city game.
NB: This project is one of many unfinished projects, you may ask, why did I abandon this project?
I abondoned this project because my pc resources could not keep up, due the addition of many high definition assets, which are suitable for pc's with high amount of power, at the time of this project, the machine I am using is a core i5-8235u processor with no dedicated graphics. In case you see this, I have not completely stoped the project, rather I am taking all ideas from this project and creating a new project with only low-poly files, that project will house many ideas of this initiall project, in case you want to check it out, it is at 
Also you may ask why didn't I  delete the project?
MAYBE I will revisit this project when I get a more powerful pc. 
Afterall what is GitHub for? Of course for hosting unfinished and finished projects.
